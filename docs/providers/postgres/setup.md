# Postgres

Postgres Database offers an easy and efficient way to store vectors via [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) extension. To use pgvector, you will need to set up a PostgreSQL database with the pgvector extension enabled or use a managed solution that provides pgvector. For a hosted/managed solution, you can use any of the cloud vendors which support [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector#hosted-postgres).

- The database needs the `pgvector` extension.
- To apply required migrations you may use any tool you are more familiar with like [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/), [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/), [DataGrip](https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/), or `psql` cli.

| ------------- | -------- | ----------------- | ---------- |
| `PG_HOST`     | Optional | Postgres host     | localhost  |

| `PG_DB`       | Optional | Postgres database | `postgres` |

## Postgres Datastore local development & testing

In order to test your changes to the Postgres Datastore, you can run the following:

1. You can run local or self-hosted instance of PostgreSQL with `pgvector` enabled using Docker, or use any of the cloud vendors which support [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector#hosted-postgres):
- [Neon](https://neon.tech/docs/release-notes/2023-02-14)
- [Crunchy Bridge](https://docs.crunchybridge.com/extensions-and-languages/extensions/)
- [bit.io](https://docs.bit.io/docs/supported-sql).

### Using Docker
```bash
docker pull ankane/pgvector
```

```bash
docker run --name pgvector -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -d postgres
```

Check PostgreSQL [official docker image](https://github.com/docker-library/docs/blob/master/postgres/README.md) for more options.

2. Apply migrations using any tool you like most [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/), [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/), [DataGrip](https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/), or `psql` cli.

```bash
# apply migrations using psql cli
psql -h PG_HOST -p PG_PORT -U PG_USER -d PG_DB -f examples/providers/supabase/migrations/20230414142107_init_pg_vector.sql
```

3. Export environment variables required for the Postgres Datastore

```bash
export PG_HOST=<PG_HOST>
export PG_PORT=<PG_PORT>
export PG_PASSWORD=<PG_PASSWORD>
```

4. Run the Postgres datastore tests from the project's root directory

```bash
# Run the Postgres datastore tests
# go to project's root directory and run
poetry run pytest -s ./tests/datastore/providers/postgres/test_postgres_datastore.py
```

5. When going to prod don't forget to set the password for the `postgres` user to something more secure and apply migrations.

6. You may want to remove RLS (Row Level Security) from the `documents` table. If you are not using RLS, it is not required in this setup. But it may be useful if you want to separate documents by user or group of users, or if you want to give permissions to insert or query documents to different users. And RLS is especially important if you are willing to use PostgREST. To do so you can just remove the following statement from the `20230414142107_init_pg_vector.sql` migration file: `alter table documents enable row level security;`.

## Indexes for Postgres

By default, pgvector performs exact nearest neighbor search. To speed up the vector comparison, you may want to create indexes for the `embedding` column in the `documents` table. You should do this **only** after a few thousand records are inserted.

As datasotre is using inner product for similarity search, you can add index as follows:

```sql
create index on documents using ivfflat (embedding vector_ip_ops) with (lists = 100);
```

To choose `lists` constant - a good place to start is records / 1000 for up to 1M records and sqrt(records) for over 1M records

For more information about indexes, see [pgvector docs](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector#indexing).
