    "The diagram above provides a high-level overview of the system, and explains how ChatGPT, the Retrieval Plugin, and KDB.AI all interact with one another. The system can be broken down into two main sub-systems: upserting (shown in red) and querying (shown in blue).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Upserting\n",
    "\n",
    "Upserting is the process of taking our own dataset and uploading it to our vector database. In order to upsert data, we must pre-process it to remove any part we do not want to store in the database, change the format to a dictionary, and divide it into batches. When we call  `/upsert`, each batch of data is embedded using an OpenAI LLM (Large Language Model), to generate a vector embedding for similarity search. The data and its embedding are then inserted into a KDB.AI table.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Querying\n",
    "\n",
    "Querying involves taking an input query, or question, transforming it into an embedded vector, and running similarity search in the vector database to find its nearest neighbours - data with closest relevancy to the query. When we call `/query`,  the input query is embedded with the same OpenAI LLM used for upserting, to generate a query vector. A similarity search algorithm running within KDB.AI will return the N closest matches with highest relevancy to the query. This \"context\" is then sent back to ChatGPT via the Retrieval Plugin. Finally, using this contextual information, ChatGPT outputs a human-like response to the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having an external source of data greatly increases the applicability of ChatGPT to different tasks. For example: GPT-3.5 can only answer questions with information it has seen during training, which is capped at 2021.. Therefore, if you asked it who the 2023 UK Prime Minister is, the model does not have the necessary information. However, if you were to download a dataset of political data up to the present day, ChatGPT would be able to use this data to answer the question. "
