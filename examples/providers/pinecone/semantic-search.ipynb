    "Before running this notebook you should have already initialized the retrieval API and have it running locally or elsewhere. The full instructions for doing this are found in the [project README]().\n",

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "1. Install Python 3.10 if not already installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Clone the `retrieval-app` repository:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone git@github.com:openai/retrieval-app.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Navigate to the app directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "cd /path/to/retrieval-app\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Install `poetry`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install poetry\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Create a new virtual environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "poetry env use python3.10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Install the `retrieval-app` dependencies:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "poetry install\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Set app environment variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `BEARER_TOKEN`: Secret token used by the app to authorize incoming requests. We will later include this in the request `headers`. The token can be generated however you prefer, such as using [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/).\n",
    "\n",
    "* `OPENAI_API_KEY`: The OpenAI API key used for generating embeddings with the OpenAI embeddings model. [Get an API key here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)!\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Set Pinecone-specific environment variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `DATASTORE`: set to `pinecone`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `PINECONE_API_KEY`: Set to your Pinecone API key. This requires a free Pinecone account and can be [found in the Pinecone console](https://app.pinecone.io/).\n",
    "\n",
    "* `PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT`: Set to your Pinecone environment, looks like `us-east1-gcp`, `us-west1-aws`, and can be found next to your API key in the [Pinecone console](https://app.pinecone.io/).\n",
    "\n",
    "* `PINECONE_INDEX`: Set this to your chosen index name. The name you choose is your choice, we just recommend setting it to something descriptive like `\"openai-retrieval-app\"`. *Note that index names are restricted to alphanumeric characters, `\"-\"`, and can contain a maximum of 45 characters.*\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Run the app with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "poetry run start\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If running the app locally you should see something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000\n",
    "INFO:     Application startup complete.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In that case, the app is automatically connected to our index (specified by `PINECONE_INDEX`), if no index with that name existed beforehand, the app creates one for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we're ready to move on to populating our index with some data."

The story associated with this miracle tells that before the Battle of Ourique (25 July 1139), an old hermit appeared before Count Afonso Henriques (future Afonso I) as a divine messenger. He foretold Afonso's victory and assured him that God was watching over him and his peers. The messenger advised him to walk away from his camp, alone, if he heard a nearby chapel bell tolling, in the following night. In doing so, he witnessed an apparition of Jesus on the cross. Ecstatic, Afonso heard Jesus promising victories for the coming battles, as well as God's wish to act through Afonso, and his descendants, in order to create an empire which would carry His name to unknown lands, thus choosing the Portuguese to perform great tasks.\n",

Fr. Sorin arrived on the site with eight Holy Cross brothers from France and Ireland on November 26, 1842, and began the school using Father Stephen Badin's old log chapel. He soon erected additional buildings, including Old College, the first church, and the first main building. They immediately acquired two students and set about building additions to the campus.\n",
      "0.79: Because of its Catholic identity, a number of religious buildings stand on campus. The Old College building has become one of two seminaries on campus run by the Congregation of Holy Cross. The current Basilica of the Sacred Heart is located on the spot of Fr. Sorin's original church, which became too small for the growing college. It is built in French Revival style and it is decorated by stained glass windows imported directly from France. The interior was painted by Luigi Gregori, an Italian painter invited by Fr. Sorin to be artist in residence. The Basilica also features a bell tower with a carillon. Inside the church there are also sculptures by Ivan Mestrovic. The Grotto of Our Lady of Lourdes, which was built in 1896, is a replica of the original in Lourdes, France. It is very popular among students and alumni as a place of prayer and meditation, and it is considered one of the most beloved spots on campus.\n",

      "0.83: In 1919 Father James Burns became president of Notre Dame, and in three years he produced an academic revolution that brought the school up to national standards by adopting the elective system and moving away from the university's traditional scholastic and classical emphasis. By contrast, the Jesuit colleges, bastions of academic conservatism, were reluctant to move to a system of electives. Their graduates were shut out of Harvard Law School for that reason. Notre Dame continued to grow over the years, adding more colleges, programs, and sports teams. By 1921, with the addition of the College of Commerce, Notre Dame had grown from a small college to a university with five colleges and a professional law school. The university continued to expand and add new residence halls and buildings with each subsequent president.\n",
      "0.83: The rise of Hitler and other dictators in the 1930s forced numerous Catholic intellectuals to flee Europe; president John O'Hara brought many to Notre Dame. From Germany came Anton-Hermann Chroust (1907–1982) in classics and law, and Waldemar Gurian a German Catholic intellectual of Jewish descent. Positivism dominated American intellectual life in the 1920s onward but in marked contrast, Gurian received a German Catholic education and wrote his doctoral dissertation under Max Scheler. Ivan Meštrović (1883–1962), a renowned sculptor, brought Croatian culture to campus, 1955–62. Yves Simon (1903–61), brought to ND in the 1940s the insights of French studies in the Aristotelian-Thomistic tradition of philosophy; his own teacher Jacques Maritain (1882–73) was a frequent visitor to campus.\n",
      "0.82: In the 18 years under the presidency of Edward Malloy, C.S.C., (1987–2005), there was a rapid growth in the school's reputation, faculty, and resources. He increased the faculty by more than 500 professors; the academic quality of the student body has improved dramatically, with the average SAT score rising from 1240 to 1360; the number of minority students more than doubled; the endowment grew from $350 million to more than $3 billion; the annual operating budget rose from $177 million to more than $650 million; and annual research funding improved from $15 million to more than $70 million. Notre Dame's most recent[when?] capital campaign raised $1.1 billion, far exceeding its goal of $767 million, and is the largest in the history of Catholic higher education.\n",
      "0.82: The Rev. John J. Cavanaugh, C.S.C. served as president from 1946 to 1952. Cavanaugh's legacy at Notre Dame in the post-war years was devoted to raising academic standards and reshaping the university administration to suit it to an enlarged educational mission and an expanded student body and stressing advanced studies and research at a time when Notre Dame quadrupled in student census, undergraduate enrollment increased by more than half, and graduate student enrollment grew fivefold. Cavanaugh also established the Lobund Institute for Animal Studies and Notre Dame's Medieval Institute. Cavanaugh also presided over the construction of the Nieuwland Science Hall, Fisher Hall, and the Morris Inn, as well as the Hall of Liberal Arts (now O'Shaughnessy Hall), made possible by a donation from I.A. O'Shaughnessy, at the time the largest ever made to an American Catholic university.\n",
